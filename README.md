# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms.
Basics of how process works in an Operating System.


In an operating system, CPU scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are executed on the CPU. Here, weâ€™ll explore several common scheduling algorithms:

1. First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
   Description: FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm. It processes the jobs in the order they arrive.
   Working:
   * Processes are placed in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.
   * The process that arrives first gets executed first.
   * Non-preemptive: Once a process starts executing, it cannot be interrupted.
   Advantages:
   *  Easy to implement.
   *  item 2 No starvation.
   Disadvantages:
   * Long average waiting time.
   * Convoy effect (inefficient resource utilization).
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
   Description: SJF schedules processes based on their burst time (execution time).
   Working:
   * Processes are sorted by burst time.
   * The process with the shortest burst time is executed first.
   * Non-preemptive (unless using Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF).
   Advantages:
   * Minimizes average waiting time.
   * Efficient for short processes.
   Disadvantages:
   * Long processes may starve.
   * Requires knowledge of burst times.
3. Round Robin (RR)
   Description: RR allocates CPU time in fixed time slices (quantum).
   Working:
   * Processes are placed in a circular queue.
   * Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum) to execute.
   * Preemptive: Processes are interrupted after their quantum.
   Advantages:
   * Fairness (equal time for all processes).
   * Suitable for time-sharing systems.
   Disadvantages:
   * High context switching overhead.
   * Inefficient for long processes.
4. Priority Scheduling
   Description: Priority scheduling assigns priorities to processes.
   Working:
   * Each process has a priority (e.g., based on burst time, importance, etc.).
   * Highest-priority process executes first.
   * Non-preemptive (unless using Preemptive Priority Scheduling).
   Advantages:
   * Prioritizes important processes.
   * Customizable based on requirements.
   Disadvantages:
   * Starvation (low-priority processes may wait indefinitely).
5. Feedback Algorithm
   Description: Feedback scheduling allows processes to move between different queues.
   Working:
   * Multiple queues with different priorities (e.g., high, medium, low).
   * Processes start in the highest-priority queue.
   * If not completed, they move to the next lower-priority queue.
   * Preemptive or non-preemptive.
   Advantages:
   * Dynamic adaptation to process behavior.
   * Supports interactive and batch processes.
   Disadvantages:
   * Complexity in managing multiple queues.
