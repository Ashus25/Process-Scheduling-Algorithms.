# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms.
Basics of how process works in an Operating System.


In an operating system, CPU scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are executed on the CPU. Here, weâ€™ll explore several common scheduling algorithms:

1. First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
   Description: FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm. It processes the jobs in the order they arrive.<br />
  * Working:
      * Processes are placed in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.
      * The process that arrives first gets executed first.
      * Non-preemptive: Once a process starts executing, it cannot be interrupted.<br />
  * Advantages:
      *  Easy to implement.
      *  No starvation.<br />
  * Disadvantages:
      * Long average waiting time.
      * Convoy effect (inefficient resource utilization).
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
   Description: SJF schedules processes based on their burst time (execution time).<br />
   * Working:
      * Processes are sorted by burst time.
      * The process with the shortest burst time is executed first.
      * Non-preemptive (unless using Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF).<br />
   * Advantages:
      * Minimizes average waiting time.
      * Efficient for short processes.<br />
   * Disadvantages:
      * Long processes may starve.
      * Requires knowledge of burst times.
3. Round Robin (RR)
   Description: RR allocates CPU time in fixed time slices (quantum).<br />
   * Working:
      * Processes are placed in a circular queue.
      * Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum) to execute.
      * Preemptive: Processes are interrupted after their quantum.<br />
   * Advantages:
      * Fairness (equal time for all processes).
      * Suitable for time-sharing systems.<br />
   * Disadvantages:
      * High context switching overhead.
      * Inefficient for long processes.
4. Priority Scheduling
   Description: Priority scheduling assigns priorities to processes.<br />
   * Working:
      * Each process has a priority (e.g., based on burst time, importance, etc.).
      * Highest-priority process executes first.
      * Non-preemptive (unless using Preemptive Priority Scheduling).<br />
   * Advantages:
      * Prioritizes important processes.
      * Customizable based on requirements.<br />
   * Disadvantages:
      * Starvation (low-priority processes may wait indefinitely).
5. Feedback Algorithm
   Description: Feedback scheduling allows processes to move between different queues.<br />
   * Working:
      * Multiple queues with different priorities (e.g., high, medium, low).
      * Processes start in the highest-priority queue.
      * If not completed, they move to the next lower-priority queue.
      * Preemptive or non-preemptive.<br />
   * Advantages:
      * Dynamic adaptation to process behavior.
      * Supports interactive and batch processes.<br />
   * Disadvantages:
      * Complexity in managing multiple queues.
